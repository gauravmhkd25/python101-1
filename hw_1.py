1. WAP to Find the Square Root
    sqrt = x**(1.0/2)
2. WAP to find area of the triangle
    If a, b and c are three sides of a triangle. Then,
        s = (a+b+c)/2
        area = √(s(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))
3. WAP to solve quadratic quation
    The standard form of a quadratic equation is:
    ax2 + bx + c = 0, where
    a, b and c are real numbers and
    a ≠ 0
